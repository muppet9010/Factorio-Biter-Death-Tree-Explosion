[mod-setting-description]
biter_reincarnation-tree_fire_max_hop_count=How many times a tree fire can hop to another free from its origin tree. The game defualt is 100 to avoid the possibility of near infinite forest fires. To leave the setting unchanged use a value of -1.
biter_reincarnation-turn_to_tree_chance_percent=The percent change of a biter turning in to a tree on death. Combined event chances can be greater than 100%.
biter_reincarnation-turn_to_burning_tree_chance_percent=The percent change of a biter turning in to a burning tree on death. The fire will spread to other trees nearby. Combined event chances can be greater than 100%.
biter_reincarnation-turn_to_rock_chance_percent=The percent change of a biter turning in to a rock on death. Rocks are large reincarnations and will obey the setting to push movable entities, crushing others. Combined event chances can be greater than 100%.
biter_reincarnation-turn_to_cliff_chance_percent=The percent change of a biter turning in to a cliff on death. Cliffs are large reincarnations and will obey the setting to push movable entities, crushing others. Combined event chances can be greater than 100%.
biter_reincarnation-large_reincarnations_push=If enabled when large things are created they will try and push movable things out of their way. Anything not moved will be crushed.
biter_reincarnation-max_reincarnations_per_second=This only includes biters that are within the reincranate chance, but will include failed reincarante attempts due to no valid placement for a tree. Reincarantions are spread out over the second to balance CPU load.
biter_reincarnation-max_seconds_wait_for_reincarnation=Max seconds a reincarnation can be queued for before its discarded. This is to stop bulk reincarnation events from causing a very long running queue.
