[mod-setting-description]
turn-to-tree-chance-percent=The percent change of a biter turning in to a tree on death. Combined event chances can be greater than 100%.
burst-into-flames-chance-percent=The percent change of a biter turning in to a burning tree on death. The fire will spread to other trees nearby. Combined event chances can be greater than 100%.
tree-fire-max-hope-count=How many times a tree fire can hop to another free from its origin tree. The game defualt is 100 to avoid the possibility of near infinite forest fires. To leave the setting unchanged use a value of -1.
max_reincarnations_per_second=This only includes biters that are within the reincranate chance, but will include failed reincarante attempts due to no valid placement for a tree. Reincarantions are spread out over the second to balance CPU load.
