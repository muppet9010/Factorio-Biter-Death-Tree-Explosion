HOTFIXES
========

- utility\functions\biome-trees.lua - BiomeTrees.AddBiomeTreeNearPosition() - returns treeName and the position it was placed
- utility\functions\biome-trees.lua - BiomeTrees._SearchForSuitableTrees() to BiomeTrees._GetTreePossibilitiesForTileData - streamlined to be more efficient by running once to cover the whole tile spectrum and then caching the results.
