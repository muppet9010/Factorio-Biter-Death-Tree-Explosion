    - Add setting for enemy units chance of turning in to tree on death.
  Changes:
    - Add script interface for using the entity generation logic.
    - Tree data is obtained from data so supports modded trees (not modded tiles).
    - Tree type selection respects tree probability so tree mix should match local natural forests more.
