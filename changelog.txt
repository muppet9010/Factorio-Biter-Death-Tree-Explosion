  Info:

Version: 20.0.21
Date: 2022-11-07
  Features:
    - This mod now integrates with the Biter Revive mod, so that a dead biter doesn't trigger both mods. Biter Revive takes priority, with a non revived biter be available to reincarnate.
    - Added mod setting to blacklist (exclude) named entity types from reincarnating.
    - Added mod setting to blacklist (exclude) entities on specific forces from reincarnating. Defaults to excluding the `player` force.
    - Mod is much more UPS efficient throughout its activities, especially in the creation of trees and in situations of excessive high biter death rates.
    - Added support for worms reincarnating. They can return as rocks, cliffs or shallow water. Dy default they don't reincarnate.
    - Added shallow water option for worms to reincarnate as. This won't ever destroy any entities or resources that would collide with the water to avoid complexity and keep gameplay smooth.
  Changes:
    - Don't exclude all units that don't have the `breaths-air` flag on them. Had no real impact for base game units and the new blacklist mod settings allow this to be covered if needed with mods, but in a much more flexible way.
    - Increased max reincarnations per second mod setting to a default of 100. Old value was 10 as old code was less UPS efficient. This will also change a save game's mod setting on mod update if the saves value was the old default. Can't update a Factorio instances (not save game) mod settings however.
    - Updated Alien Biomes tile and tree data to latest version (0.6.8), no major changes observed.
    - The mod only records reincarnations if they can be completed within the time span set by the settings. This is to reduce UPS impact when very large numbers of biters die in a short time span and wouldn't be processed for reincarnation quickly enough anyways. It does mean when reincarnations per second and max reincarnation wait time settings are changed there may be a few seconds delay before they fully take effect.
    - Spawners and worms won't be crushed by large reincarnations any more. As this could mean killing a biter which reincarnated as a cliff could kill a worm instantly.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix that if large entity push option was disabled things weren't actually crushed.
