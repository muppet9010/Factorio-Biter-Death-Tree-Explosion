TODO
----

    - move to doing the reincarnation queue check at a set frequency using script.on_nth_tick() like biter revive does. We've currently got the overhead cost of an adhoc tick scheduler, but we do it all at regular intervals.
    - make the code in `Reincarnation.ProcessReincarnationQueue()` only run if there is actually something to remove, can use next() to check it, like Revive mod does.
    - try using shallow water to see if suitable for reincarnating worms.



FUTURE IDEAS
------------

    - Add mod options to reincarnate worms. This should be a worm set of the mod settings that control chances. Set defaults to be 0 for all. Don't include tree as that would just be odd.
    - If chance settings are all off for a type (unit/worm) then don't need to react to any events for that type.
    - Handle custom rock types that alien biomes adds for many of the colored areas. Can also pick regular and sandy rocks for base Factorio tiles if base game links rock type to tiles ?
