FUTURE IDEAS
------------

    - If chance settings are all off for a type (unit/worm) then don't need to react to any events for that type.
    - Handle custom rock types that alien biomes adds for many of the colored areas. Can also pick regular and sandy rocks for base Factorio tiles if base game links rock type to tiles ?
