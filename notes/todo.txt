    - Add demo video to mod readme.




FUTURE IDEAS
------------

    - Add mod options to reincarnate worms. This should be a worm set of the mod settings that control chances. Set defaults to be 0 for all.
    - If chance settings are all off for a type (unit/worm) then don't need to react to any events for that type.
