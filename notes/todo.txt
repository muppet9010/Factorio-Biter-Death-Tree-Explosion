TODO
----

    - profile iterating global.reincarnationQueue as it seems very inefficient when lots of biters are queued for reincarnation. As we both reshuffle all the entries in the table when removing one.




FUTURE IDEAS
------------

    - Add mod options to reincarnate worms. This should be a worm set of the mod settings that control chances. Set defaults to be 0 for all.
    - If chance settings are all off for a type (unit/worm) then don't need to react to any events for that type.
